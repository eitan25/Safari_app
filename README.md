The saffary app is a small game.
The player can create different animels on screen.
There is one lion in the safary that pursue the closest animel if the player alow "Hunger".
The lion eat the animels until he is not hungry anymore, and then he rest.

Game Features:
  1. Create different animels in the safari.
  2. Make the lion hungry so he will eat the animels.
  3. Lion stops eating when he is not hungry anymore (when progress bar is full)
  4. Animels move to random places when created, in a pre-defined speed. (rabit is faster then a giraffe)
